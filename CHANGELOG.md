# v0.2.0~pre9

## ⚖️ Balance

### Jokers

- **Hadron Collider** now grants X0.2 per hand matching criteria played (from X0.35).
  - In general, early Flush gameplans felt like they had a too easy time scaling this Joker compared to other scaling uncommon options. They still do, but hopefully this forces some hand expenditure.
- **Microtransaction Cards** XChips output has been increased to 1.2, 1.35, 1.5, 1.8 respectively (from 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5).
  - With the general negative effects of these cards on economy, it felt warranted to make them slightly stronger.
  - This should counteract the devastating effects of losing 1-2 dollar per card for early plans.
  - In general, lategame builds which aim to use Epic MTX cards as stabler alternatives to Glass cards will still find themselves struggling to keep up economically without proper planning.
  - SMODS fix for Microtransaction cards is still pending (currently negative p_dollars on enhancement has no effect).
