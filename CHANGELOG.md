## ‚öñÔ∏è Balance

### Jokers
* **Fool's Gambit** now has a 1 in 2 chance to not add Faded Polychrome (from 1 in 4).
* **The Rook** now creates two copies of Tower.
* **En Passant** no longer removes Seal or Enhancement if transfer targets already have the same Seal or Enhancement.

* **Cairo** now also creates 1 copy of Ankh, but is now Uncommon.
* **Budapest** and **Nice** is now Common.
* **Boston** is now Rare.

### Planets
* Added diminishing returns to **Europa** and **Io**
* Reduced the bonus granted by **Europa** and **Io** to 0.025 per use. **Io** in particular may warrant further intervention.

### Mechanics
* Reduced base Mortgage rate to $15 (from $20).
* **Haunted** cards create **Ephemeral** consumables, which are Negative but self-destruct after 3 rounds.
* **Scenic** edition now also grows when the edition itself triggers to avoid complete dud hits, but starts from +2 chips growth now to somewhat alleviate the early game power spike.
